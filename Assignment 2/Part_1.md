Assignment 2, Part 1 : Neural Network

Create a neural network which can classify types of penguin based on their physical details (bill length, etc). 

After training for 100 epochs, the network was getting 83% accuracy on the training data. Using the trained network, it was able to get 82% accuracy on the test data. This proved that the resulting network wasn't overfitted to the training data. 

## Adding Bais Nodes

Adding bias nodes to the network allowed it to reach 82% by the 8th epoch and 99% on the 100th epoch. Thankfully, the fully trained program also reached 100% accuracy on the test data. This indicated that adding the bias nodes prevented the program from overfitting while also pushing accuracy of the program.
