# Assignment 3, Part 2 : Naive Bayes Classifier 

Create a program that implements the naive bayes method to calculate the probability of an email being spam using phrases commonly found in spam emails (eg. Nigerian Prince, $, send).

The Naive Bayes Classifier assumes conditional independence, that there is no connection between phrases appearing in the email. While this is not true, measuring assuming conditional independence is much easier and requires less training data.
