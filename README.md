# Artificial Intelligence

This course addresses concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). It provides a brief overview of AI history and search techniques, as well as covering important machine learning topics and algorithms with their applications, including neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. Other topics include probability and Bayesian networks, planning and scheduling. The course will also give a brief overview of a selection of other current topics in AI.

### Course content
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. Examples include self-driving cars, automatically planning a holiday, generating sensible conversation, learning to predict fog at Wellington Airport, reading a web page to get the answer to a question, recognising handwritten digits, detecting identity by checking fingerprints, detecting network intrusions, controlling robot actuators, processing and recognising images and signals, discovering and detecting the mathematical or logical relationship between output variables and a large number of inputs in economic and engineering tasks, or optimising parameter values in complex engineering problems. AIML 420 is an introduction to the ideas and techniques that computer scientists have developed to address these kinds of tasks.
 
The lectures cover following main topics: search techniques, machine learning including basic learning concepts and algorithms, neural networks and evolutionary learning, reasoning under uncertainty, planning and scheduling, knowledge based systems and AI Philosophy. The course includes a substantial amount of programming. The course will cover both science and engineering applications.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Explain fundamental concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas of advanced search, machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, planning and scheduling.
2. Apply fundamental concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence to real world problems in regression, classification, clustering and simple planning tasks.
3. Critically evaluate AI techniques described in AI research publications.
